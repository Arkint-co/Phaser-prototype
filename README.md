Make sure you have node installed (v4.3 and 6.9.2 should work)

e.g.
```sh
cd /Users/username/localdev2/Phaser-prototype/http-server
```

Execute the following command to start up your server on localhost:

```sh
node ./bin/http-server
```
(Note: you can specify a port using -p {{portnumber}})

# Test Configuration
Open a browser window and go to:
```sh
http://localhost{{portnumber}}/hellophaser
